          <h1>WHAT THIS STORY MEANS TO US</h1>
          <p>
            This film documents the life of an immigrant family whoâ€™s narrative
            is becoming increasingly more common in the US. Family separation is
            the direct result of strict immigration policies that rarely to take
            into account personal circumstance and individual values.
            <br />
            <br /> We wanted to tell this story because we witnessed a lack of
            proper representation in the media and strongly believe that honest,
            true storytelling has the ability to bring about change.
            <br />
            <br />
            We had the privilege to follow the Guerra family over the course of
            9 months from August 2016 to April 2017. We hope their story can
            both inspire and educate others.
